## What are hooks?
Hooks are new feature addition in React version 16.8 which allow you to use React features without having to write a class. For example state. State was only availabe within classes but now you can use state without writting a class. Hooks do not work inside classes. 

## Why Hooks?
- Allow you to use React features without having to write a class.
- Avoid the whole confusion with **this** keyword.
- Allow you to reuse statful logic without changing your component hierarchy.
- Hooks let us organize the logic inside the component into reusable isolated unit.

## Rules of Hooks
- **Only call hooks at the top level.**  Do not call hooks inside loops, conditions or nested functions.

- **Only call hooks from React functions.** Call them from within React functional compmonent and not just any regular java script function.
