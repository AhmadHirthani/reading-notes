## Why would a developer choose to make data models?
Data models accelerate development, reduce maintenance, increase application quality, and lower execution risks. It is basically the blueprint for a building, outlining all of the details that will result in the proper operation of the application.

## What purpose do CRUD operations serve?
This is a shortcut for Create, Read, Update and Delete. Those are the main operations that we can perform on a database.

## What kind of database is Postgres? What kind of database is MongoDB?
Postgres is SQL and MongoDB is NoSQL

## What is Mongoose and why do we need it?
Mongoose is a package or library that used to work with MongoDB in NodeJs. It helps in writing less code in easier way.

## Define three related pieces of data in a possible application. An example for a store application might be Product, Category and Department. Describe the constraints and rules on each piece of data and how you would relate these pieces to each other. For example, each Product has a Category and belongs in a Department.
In university application we have student, faculty and student status.
Each student has status and belongs to faculty.

## Database: 
Database is a file contains one table or more. These tables contain a well-organized data. This data’s source vary. It can be a user input, statistics from a website or data from a hospital. We use database for saving, retrieving, updating or deleting data.

## Data model:
Data model is a folder that contains model files. Each model file define how data is connected to each other and how they are processed and stored inside the system.

## CRUD:
This is a shortcut for Create, Read, Update and Delete. Those are the main operations that we can perform on a database.

## Schema:
Shema is a description for a structure. If we said that this file should follow this schema, this means the file should contain the information’s and datatypes as specified in the schema.

## Sanitize:
means that you remove all dangerous characters from an input string before passing it to the SQL engine.

## Structured Query Language (SQL):
Sometimes we called it Relational Database. The main features in SQL that it can join more than one table to make a query from more than one table in one query. This join process depends in the ability pf making relations between tables. The other feature in SQL that any data record should follow strict predefined schema.

## Non SQL (NoSQL):
Sometimes we called it non-Relational Database. The main features in SQL that there is no need to join more than one table to make a query from more than one table in one query. The other feature in SQL that any data record should not follow strict predefined schema. This means a flexible way off adding data to DB.

## MongoDB:
MongoDB is one of the famous NoSQL databases. It is easy to use and you can store you database cloud instead of storing it locally in your device.

## Mongoose:
Mongoose is a package or library that used to work with MongoDB in NodeJs. It helps in writing less code in easier way.

## Record:
In SQL databases, record is a raw in the database that contains a data for a specific object.

## Document:
In NoSQL databases, document is the alternative of record in SQL databases. This means it is a raw in the database that contains a data for a specific object.

## Object Relation Mapping (ORM):
In computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages.

## Repository pattern:
Repository pattern separates the data access logic and maps it to the business entities in the business logic. Communication between the data access logic and the business logic is done through interfaces. To put it simply, Repository pattern is a kind of container where data access logic is stored. It hides the details of data access logic from business logic. In other words, we allow business logic to access the data object without having knowledge of underlying data access architecture. The separation of data access from business logic have many benefits. Some of them are:
•	Centralization of the data access logic makes code easier to maintain
•	Business and data access logic can be tested separately
•	Reduces duplication of code
•	A lower chance for making programming errors
