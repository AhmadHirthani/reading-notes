# Rule Based Access Control RBAC
RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization. It's important to remember that not every employee needs a starring role.

## Benfit of using RBAC
The policy need not to be updated when a certain person with a role leaves the orgnization.  
When new employee comes to the orgnazation, we only need to pick a role for him for role's list according to his tesks.  
If you want to change user's privillages, you only change in the role's privillages instead of goimg to each employee and edit his privillages.

## 5 steps to simple role-based access control (RBAC)
### 1. Inventory your systems

Figure out what resources you have for which you need to control access, if you don't already have them listed. Examples would include an email system, customer database, contact management system, major folders on a file server, etc. 

### 2. Analyze your workforce and create roles

You need to group your workforce members into roles with common access needs.  Avoid the temptation to have too many roles defined. Keep them as simple and stratified as possible.

For example, you might have a basic user role, which includes the access any employee would need, such as email and the intranet site. Another role might be a customer service rep, that would have read/write access to the customer database, and a customer database administrator, that would have full control of the customer database. 

### 3. Assign people to roles

Now that you have a list of roles and their access rights, figure out which role(s) each employee belongs in, and set their access accordingly. 

### 4. Never make one-off changes

Resist any temptation to make a one-off change for an employee with unusual needs. If you begin doing this, your RBAC system will quickly begin to unravel. Change the roles as required or add new ones when really necessary. 

### 5. Audit

Periodically review your roles, the employees assigned to them, and the access permitted for each. If you discover, for example, that a role has unnecessary access to a particular system, change the role and adjust the access level for all employees in that role.
