# How to Solve Programming Problems
When most programmers are given a programming problem in an interview, they make several key mistakes.  The most severe of those is the improper allocation of time.
Any programmer like to start coding directly but this is not the prooper way and it may not be success. You must resist this urge to give yourself a time for thinking, planing and solving the problem manually. Here is a set of steps that control the process of problem solving. Note that 4 of 6 are not coding.
1. Read the problem completely twice.
#### The more you read the problem, the more you understand it.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
#### It is important to have a manual solution for the problem then test it 3 times with diffeerent values. This step ensures that your soluation is valid for any case.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
#### No you have your soluation, think agian if you can optimize it. 
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
#### Now it is time to document your solution by writing it as steps or as a pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
#### If you have a pesudo-code or solving steps written, it is easy to start coding. All you need is to translate the steps or pesudo-code to the programming language you are working on.
6. Optimize the real code.
#### This is an important step espaially for professionals. Even if you have a runing code, you should optmize it.

# How to value your time?
Time is life. If are busy, then you can not do anything because you do not have time. The big advice in valuing your time is to pretend your time is worth $1,000/Hour and you’ll become 100x more productive. This is a rallity. If you think of tima as money you stop loosing time right now. Do not say I am busy because  “Busyness” is not a badge of honor, it is a sign of weakness and the discription of successful people that the are focused not busy.

# How to think like a programmer
Unless you have a system, this is probably how you “solve” problems:
1. Try a solution.
2. If that doesn’t work, try another one.
3. If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.
So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem? Here are the steps:
1. Understand
#### Read the problem and try to imagine it, draw in a paper the input and the expected output. At the end of this setp, you are supposed to know exactly what is being asked.

2. Plan
#### This means don’t start hacking straight away. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information. And do not forget to write or draw some titles, relation, inputs or outputs. To get a good plan, answer this question: **Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?**

3. Divide
#### This is the most important setep. Instad of working with one bug problem, you can divide it into smaller ones. Treating a small problem is very easy when compared with a big problem. After solving all sub problems, connect all your “sub-solutions” and this will give you the solution to the original problem.

4. What if I’m stuck and can’t even solve a sub-problem?
##### This happens to everyone!. The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated. In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:
1. Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging.
2. Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
3. Serach on Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

Another important thing to be a good problem-solver is practice. Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with  a specific concept”. In fact, a common pattern amongst successful people is their habit of practicing “micro problem-solving.” For example, Peter Thiel plays chess, and Elon Musk plays video-games.
