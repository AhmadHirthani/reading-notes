# Graph
Graph is one of non linear data structures, it is a collection of objects or entities that we call nodes or vertices connected to each other through a set of edges. Unlike tree conection which connected in a certain way. In tree, child can only have on parent but in graph it can have more than one parent. No roles in graph for relations between nodes.

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
**Complete Graphs:** A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.

**Connected:** A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge.

**Disconnected:** A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
