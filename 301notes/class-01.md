# SMACSS and Responsive Web Design
## SMACSS
If you are new to CSS you should be confused of it. This is normal because the bigger your project, the harder CSS. This problem happend when you want to add a style for an element in a big project. At that moment, you do not know if you have a style code already found for this element or not and if it is already found which selector you used to access it. There is a way to know the sorce of element's style but in programming more steps means more time. **SMACSS** comes trying to make working with css more easier by organizing css files into a group of css files, each file takes a specific part of css. There are five types of categories: Base, Layout, Module, State and Theme. **Base** almost contains exclusively single element selectors. **Layout rules** divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together. **Modules** are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on. **State rules** are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state. Is it hidden or expanded? Is it active or inactive? They are about describing how a module or layout looks on screens that are smaller or bigger. They are also about describing how a module might look in different views like the home page or the inside page. **Theme rules** are similar to state rules in that they describe how modules or layouts might look. Most sites donâ€™t require a layer of theming but it is good to be aware of it.
