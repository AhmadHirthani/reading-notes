# SQL database
## What is database (DB)?
A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. Computer databases typically contain aggregations of data records or files, containing information about sales transactions or interactions with specific customers.

## Why to use DB?
Database in one of the most important parts of all types of applications devlopment. It is used to store our data with enough size, secure place, easy to access and in an orgnaized manner.

## SQL
SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases. It stands for Structured Query Language. SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.

## RDMS
RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. The data in RDBMS is stored in database objects called tables. A table is a collection of related data entries and it consists of columns and rows.

## SQL Syntax
Before going to SQL syntax, we shoul learn about **Database Tables**. Database most often contains one or more tables. Each table is identified by a name (e.g. "Customers" or "Orders"). Tables contain records (rows) with data. Each row in the table called record which represen an onject, student for example.
Another concept we should learn before diving into SQL syntax is **SQL Statements**. Most of the actions you need to perform on a database are done with SQL statements.
SQL syntax is very simple, it start with the word select then the description of the data we want then the word from then the table's name and we finish the syntax with semicolon.

### Example  
#### SELECT * FROM Customers;
This example means  give me everything in the table called Customers.
