 # CSS Layout
 Using thc CSS layout we can modify the element layout properties such as position. Position is very important to orgnaize the layout of your web page. Positon property has five options: static, relative, fixed, absolute and sticky. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page. An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position. An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
