## Intro
## What is a script?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. For example it is like a recipe that you shold follow to a step by step tm make a specified meal. Scripts are like instruction to computer to implement it line by line. To write a script, first of all you should define your big goal then devide the goal into smaller goals. Write the steps as notes then start writting a script for each step. Your script must be in a language that computer can read and understand it. Any programming language must have two main components, vocabulary and syntax. Vocabulary is the words that computer understand and the syntax is how to arrange these words to form a script.

## Expression
Each expression will result in one value and there is two types of expressions, expression to assign value to a variable and expression that uses two or more values to return one value. For example the expression "var area = 3 * 2;" will multipli 3 with 2 and then assign the result to the variable area. 

## Operators
Operators is important so that expressions allow programmes to return one value from two or more values.

### ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
The expression "color = 'beige';" will assign the value beige to the variable color.

### ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
In arithmetic operator we + for ADDITION, - for SUBTRACTION, / for DIVISION, * for MULTIPLICATION, ++ for INCREMENT, -- for DECREMENT and % for MODULUS. For example, the expression "area = 3 * 2;" will multipli 3 with 2 and then assign the result to the variable area. 

### STRING OPERATORS 
The expression "greeting= 'Hi ' + 'Molly';" will assign the value Hi Molly to the variable greeting.
besides the pre mentioned operators we also have ### COMPARISON OPERATORS and ### LOGICAL OPERATORS which we will cover later.
