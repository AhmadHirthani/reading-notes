# HTML Images
Whenever you build a website, most likely you will need to add images to your site to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart in your site. HTML is the responsible part for adding images to websites.
To add images to a web page we use the \<img> element without closing tag. In the \<img> tag there is a mandatory attribute called src. Src refers to the path of the image you eant to include either it was alink or it was inside your project folder. Beside src, we have alt attribute to describe the content of an image in case of website can not load the image.

# CSS Color
Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions. In computer, red, green and blue RGB are the basic colors and any other colors are a mix of these three colors. So identify a new color you need to select three values: R, G and B. Instead of selecting three values we can directly write the color by normal name or by hex code. For example: rgb values (102,205,170), hex code #66cdaa and Color Name MediumAquaMarine will revloute to the samw color. In css we have many attributes that takes color as a value such as font color and background color. In CSS3 new HSL colors was intrduced. HSL is a shortcut for hue, saturation and lightness. The things that makes HSL better than the others that HSL is noe selecting the color only, but it is used to select the color including the contrast value which was specified seperatly before HSL. 
## Color Example
