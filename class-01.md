# How the Web Works
Each website must be hosted in a device called web server. This web server must have a unique number called IP. To reach the website you must know the IP of the web server. Due to fact that it is very hard for human to memorize the IPs of web servers, the DNS was founded. DNS Domain Name Server works as a phonebook that translate the alphabet address of website to the IP address of the web server. Translation process performed automatically between your browser and DNS server.

# HTML
We have a lot of documents type in our life and each type has its own syntax, HTML is a type of document with a special syntax. HTML is a language that describes the content of web pages. HTML syntax based on tags and a group of elements inside these tags. Each element should have two tags, open tag and close tag. For example to add a paragraph we use the tag <p> our paragraph </p>.
We start the HTML document with tag DOCTYPE to tell the browser, which is translate the HTML to a view, tell the browser that this is an HTML document also we can advertise the version of html 4 or 5. 
HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Page.  Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag. Tags act like containers. between the opening and closing tags you can find some information.
During our working with HTML we may face more than one element with the same tag. What if we want to deal with a specific element? Thanks for attributes we can add id attribute inside the opening tag and write a unique id for this tag.

## Escape Characters
We have characters which have a meaning to html and writing these characters will result in something for example the angle will result the start of tag. What if we want to print angle or angled brackets on the screen. HTML provides us with codes that results in printing these characters for example &lt will print angled brackets on the screen.

## Why HTML 5?
We mentioned that we have two versions of HTML. HTML 5 comes to be easier since we declare the elements with their real names instead of using the IDs to name the divs tags. But unfortunately HTML 5 is not supported from all browsers.

## How to start?
Before start coding, you need to answer 5 questions. If you do, you will have a good webpage with a lot of visitors. The answers for these question must be clear to help in putting thing in the right place and organize your webpage in professional manner.

Who is the Site For? Why People Visit YOUR Website? What Your Visitors are trying to Achieve? What Information Your Visitors Need? How Often People Will Visit Your Site?

## Site map
Site map is very useful since it gives you an overall look to the site's pages and how they will be grouped and the relation between these pages.

## Wireframes
Wireframe is a drawn description for the key elements in each page of the site.
