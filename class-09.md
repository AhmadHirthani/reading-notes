# Forms
Until this moment we know only one wat to take user’s input, but there is another wat to take the input from the user. This is way depends on forms.
Forms are predesigned collection of radio checkbox, input text field or multi-check box besides the buttons that used to take the input from the user.
## How Forms Work
When the user add the information to the form then he press the button to submit. When submit button pressed, the data from the form will be sent to server in the form of map (key and value). The server in the backend will treat the data and sent the result or reply to the user.

## Form Structure
We can declare form using the tag \<form>. The tag form can include attributes like id, action and method. Method is the way of sending form’s data (post or get). Action’s value is the URL of server which will receive the form’s data. Inside the form we can create text area using the tag \<input> inside the \<form> tag with the attribute type=’text’. Also we can add password input by adding the \<input> with the attribute type=’password’ to the \<form> tag.

## HTML5: Form Validation
Form validation job is to check if the user’s input meet server’s requirement or not.

# Lists, Tables and Forms style
Beside the basic CSS properties we have a special type of CSS properties which is founded especially to control the layout of lists, tables and forms.
** list-style-type ** control the style of UL and OL, for example in UL you can choose the symbol in the start of the item to be disc, circle or square and in OL you choose the list’s numbering to be decimal,decimal-leading-zero, lower-alpha, upper-alpha, lower-roman or upper- roman. Also in UL, you can choose the symbol in the start of the item to be an image by using ** list-style-image ** . Another important thing in the lists which is the place of the symbol or marker which can be inside the text taking from the text space or outside the text and this property can done using the **list-style-position**. . ** list-style-type ** , **list-style-image** and **list-style-position** can be declared in on line using the **list-style**.  
# JavaScript Events
Events are a huge feature when it comes to using JavaScript. Events is something that happens all the time, any time we use the browser or website. For example if you want to resize the browser, go to another website, click a link inside a website or move mouse inside website. The benefit of events is to make the website react in a certain way when we do something inside the browser. We have two types of events browser levelled events and DOM levelled events.
In browser levelled events, we have tons of events such as load, resize and scroll. In DOM levelled events we have a bunch of different ones such as clicking on something, drag mouse, move mouse around and form based events which activates anytime we do anything using form.
